\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. Now my two-time alma mater, I will miss being a student at this University. \'a0Despite it's faults (which I assume every school has in the opinion of the attendees), USF from my experience has the most caring, competent, and notable professors that contribute greatly to the academic experience you will have while there. \'a0There is a lot of history on the main campus as well as many newly added facilities when it recently got a face lift.Across the street from the main campus (also on Fulton Street) is the law school. \'a0If you want a unique legal education with fantastic opportunities to build your skills before truly entering your career as an attorney, this is the place to be. \'a0Zief Library is a beautiful building with many staffed librarians armed with all the resources you need to successfully complete a research issue and draft various legal documents.\
