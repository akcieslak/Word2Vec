# Word2Vec
I am currently working with Word2Vec to find similarity between words. First, I read in data and parse it to find the 50 most common
words in the data. Then I use the Word2Vec model to find the most similar words to each word in the top 50 list. The user is given the 
option to use the Word2Vec with the original data or with the parsed data (takes out stop words and unnecessary additions to text)
